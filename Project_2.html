									<h2>About the Project</h2>
									<p>Basic Task: Using Python I had to create a game of rock, paper, scissors as well as a webpage with statistics and analysis of this code.</p>
									<p>Following on from the basic task I used python to calculate the statistics for me, instead of just announce the winner of the game. I didn't find this piece of code to be that bad and enjoyed making things work.</p>
									<p>I really enjoyed this project, espeacially using HTML as I'd just started learning about it but really liked how you can see what you change live. I also like being able to watchas as your webpage slowly grows.</p>
									<hr />
									<p>**This project is in the form of a webpage which will have a different format to this site as I've left it exactly how it was when I made it.</p>
									<p>Here is the link for the webpage: <a href="Non_Transitive_Games.html" class="button">Non-Transitive Games</a></p>
